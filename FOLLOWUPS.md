# Follow-ups

In-scope tangents found while working — important to fix, but they'd derail the task
at hand. Add a numbered `## N.` section below instead of chasing them now, and
**clear these before starting a new feature.** New features and larger efforts go in
`ROADMAP.md`, not here.

Each item keeps the detail fields (**Identified / What / Why / Context / Effort**) that
save the next person a grep. Mark a finished item with a `**Status:** done` line rather
than deleting it; completed items are pruned and the rest renumbered on a periodic
cleanup pass.

<!-- Template — copy for each item, numbering sequentially:
## N. Short title
**Status:** open
- **Identified:** YYYY-MM-DD and the work it came up in
- **What:** brief description
- **Why:** motivation / value
- **Context:** file paths, gotchas, anything that saves grep time
- **Effort:** XS (<1 h) / S (1–4 h) / M (1 day) / L (multi-day) -->

## 1. Beastheart source says "Animal Handling"; the skill is "Handle Animals"

**Status:** open

- **Identified:** 2026-06-02, beastheart linking pass.
- **What:** The beastheart class skill grant (`Draw Steel Beastheart.md`, Basics, ~L294) reads "You gain the **Animal Handling** skill" and lists "Animal Handling" in the Quick Build. The actual Draw Steel skill is **Handle Animals** (`mcdm.heroes.v1/skill/handle-animals`). Left UNLINKED to avoid a display-text/term mismatch; "Navigate" and "Track" on the same line were linked.
- **Why:** Either the source has a naming inconsistency to correct (rename to "Handle Animals"), or it's an intentional alt-name that should be linked to `skill/handle-animals` with alt display text. Resolve, then link.
- **Context:** Single occurrence pair on one line. Confirm against the Beastheart PDF (book Basics page) before renaming source content. If renamed, also link it to `skill/handle-animals`.
- **Effort:** XS

## 2. Beastheart companion stat blocks not published to Browse (broken `feature-group/companion/*` links)

**Status:** open

- **Identified:** 2026-06-02, Read-tab-by-book work
- **What:** Companion stat blocks are emitted as `feature-group/companion/<name>.md` in `md-linked`, but `feature-group/` is **not** in `v2/site.yaml`'s Browse `include:` list, so companion pages are never published. Every `scc:.../feature-group.companion/<name>` cross-reference (≈7 distinct companions, ~26 link instances across the Beastheart class page and the new `Read/beastheart/the-beastheart-class.md` chapter) therefore dangles. Pre-existing on `main` (the Beastheart class page on the live site had the same broken links); the Read-tab work duplicated the links into the Read chapter but did not cause the root gap.
- **Why it matters:** Companion stat blocks are core Beastheart content; the links are clickable-but-404. Adding `feature-group/` to the Browse `include:` would publish them and resolve the links — but first confirm companions are *meant* to be standalone Browse pages vs. embedded-only in the class page (they already render inline in the class subtree). If standalone, also decide their index/title treatment.
- **Context:** `v2/site.yaml` Browse `include:`; companion sources in `data/data-beastheart/en/md-linked/feature-group/companion/`. `matchesSection` uses prefix matching, so `feature/` does **not** match `feature-group/`.
- **Effort:** S (one-line include + verify) once the design intent is confirmed.

## 3. Stale top-level nav entry `Full Book`

**Status:** done

- **Identified:** 2026-06-02, Read-tab-by-book work
- **What:** `v2/docs/.nav.yml` (committed, protected from the site builder's clean) lists a `Full Book` nav item that matches no file/dir, producing an `awesome-nav` warning on every build. Pre-existing (present on `main`, commit "Adjusting nav").
- **Why it matters:** Minor — a persistent build warning and a dead tab slot. Remove the line or point it at real content.
- **Effort:** XS
- **Resolution:** 2026-06-03 — Removed the `Full Book` line from `v2/docs/.nav.yml` (it was unsupported and the full-book page loaded too slowly). Also dropped the now-stale `Full Book` mention from the `reading-progress.js` header comment. Verified via `mkdocs build`: the `awesome-nav` warning for `Full Book` no longer appears.

## 4. `transform_indexes.py` is dead code for the current card index pages

**Status:** open

- **Identified:** 2026-06-04, card markdown-rendering / `.md`-link fix
- **What:** `v2/scripts/transform_indexes.py` (run as step 4 of the `just deploy-v2` / `update` recipe) only matches files named `_Index.md` or `Index.md` (capitalized) via `rglob`, and only rewrites markdown **tables** into `browse-index` lists. The current `steel-etl site` builder emits lowercase `index.md` pages rendered as raw-HTML `sc-card` grids (see `internal/site/cards.go`), which the script never matches and which contain no tables. So the step is effectively a **no-op** — it transforms nothing on a normal build.
- **Why it matters:** Dead pipeline step is misleading (it looks like index pages are post-processed when they aren't — this cost real debugging time tracing how card links resolve). Either remove the step from the justfile + delete the script, or confirm whether any remaining table-style `Index.md` pages still depend on it before deleting.
- **Context:** `v2/justfile` step 4 (`scripts/transform_indexes.py docs/Browse`); the script's `main()` globs `_Index.md` / `Index.md` only. Card pages are generated lowercase `index.md` by `buildCardsContent` in `steel-etl/internal/site/cards.go`. Confirm with `find v2/docs/Browse -name 'Index.md' -o -name '_Index.md'` (expected: none) before removing.
- **Effort:** XS (verify no matches, then drop the step + script)
